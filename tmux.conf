# shortcut key is ctrl-a
# Mapping caps lock to ctrl makes this a very easy key combo to use.
# To do so on Gnome:
# - open Tweak Tool -> Typing -> Caps Lock Key Behaviour
# - choose "Make Caps Lock an additional Ctrl"
# On macOS:
# - System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Modifier Keys
# - change Caps Lock to Control
set -g prefix C-a
# send a second ctrl-a through to the contained application:
bind C-a send-prefix

# Reload configuration with r
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display "Reloaded ~/.tmux.conf"

# count windows from 1 instead of 0
# makes windows match up with the keyboard

# better pane splitting:
bind | split-window -h
bind - split-window -v

# vim-like pane movement:
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R

# cycle through windows:
bind -r C-h select-window -t :-
bind -r C-l select-window -t :+

# repeatable quick pane resizing:
# This is the same as pane movement, but capitalized
bind -r H resize-pane -L 5
bind -r J resize-pane -D 5
bind -r K resize-pane -U 5
bind -r L resize-pane -R 5
