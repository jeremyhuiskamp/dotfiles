\set QUIET -- don't log during this initialization

-- visual display of nulls with an otherwise-unlikely character:
\pset null 'Â¤'

\timing

-- for wide output, list columns vertically
\pset expanded auto

-- Per database history files.
-- NB: this is not per-host, so databases with the same name on different hosts
--     will share history.  Per-host would be tough, as connections are often
--     tunneled over ssh, making psql unaware of where it's really connecting.
\set HISTFILE ~/.psql_history- :DBNAME

\unset QUIET -- back to normal logging
